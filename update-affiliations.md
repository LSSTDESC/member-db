# Update Affiliations

There is a new interface in the DESC member database to update, add, and order multiple affiliations. 

**Note:** If you have changed affiliations and previously registered your credentials from your old institution with SLAC to access Confluence and PubDB, and will lose those credentials, you should [update your federated identity registration](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/slac-authentication-transition/wiki/Updating-Your-Federated-login-When-Changing-Institutions).
